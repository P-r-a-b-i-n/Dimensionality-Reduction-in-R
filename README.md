# Dimensionality-Reduction-in-R


Dimensionality reduction finds a lower number of variables or removes the least important variables from the model. 
That will reduce the model's complexity and also remove some noise in the data. 
In this way, dimensionality reduction helps to mitigate overfitting.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multi-dimensional scaling(MDS) are some of the many methods used to reduce dimensions.
